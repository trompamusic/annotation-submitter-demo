# TROMPA Music Scholars Annotator application demo

![Screenshot demonstrating selectable score](scholars-demo.png)

## Introduction

This repository contains a minimal example React application integrating the TROMPA [selectable-score](https://github.com/trompamusic/selectable-score) React component and is an expanded version of the [selectable-score-demo](https://github.com/trompamusic/selectable-score-demo). To run it, clone this repository, then:

```
cd music-scholars-annotator
npm install
npm start
```

Now point your web browser at https://localhost:8080. Wait a few moments for the solid login prompt, insert your crendentials and then let [Verovio](http://www.verovio.org) render the score.

Click and drag to select MEI elements (either notes or measures in this example); hold down shift or ctrl to select discontinuous regions. The app lets you insert your annotation comments, choose what type of annotation you would like to insert (either a URI link or a plain text comment) and then POST them to your solid pod annotation.

## Known issues

Paging is currently very slow. We're working on improving this, through [MELD](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld) optimisations and potentially by running Verovio as a Web Worker (work in progress!)

Currently the app POSTs annotaion to your public/ solid pod folder. In the near future it will create pertinent folders if they are not present, such as trompa/annotation/mahler or something similar.
